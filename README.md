# Process Scheduling algorithm simulation

SZTE university project, Operating Systems talent program.

---------- **WIP** ----------

I measure various aspects of different process schedulers found in operating systems with this simulation.

I implement the 
 - algorithms
 - methods to generate the processes probablistically
 - Reporting system that gives insights into the result of the simulation

If you have the Go toolchain, see available algorithms with:
```sh
go run cmd/sched/main.go --help
```

Or run the simulation with the default algorithm with:
```sh
go run cmd/sched/main.go
```
